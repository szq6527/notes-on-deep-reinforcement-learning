# Reinforcement Learning Notes

This repository contains my personal study notes on Reinforcement Learning, which I began compiling in the summer of 2025. The notes are written in LaTeX to ensure high-quality typesetting for mathematical equations.

## Content Sources

The content is primarily based on my learning from the following excellent resources:

*   **Mathematical Principles of Reinforcement Learning**
    *   An online course from Westlake University.
    *   [Link to Bilibili Course](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1sd4y167NS/)

*   **CS 224R: Deep Reinforcement Learning**
    *   A course offered by Stanford University.
    *   [Official Course Website](https://cs224r.stanford.edu/)

## Viewing the Notes

The notes are written in `.tex` files. The final, compiled PDF can be found in this repository.
